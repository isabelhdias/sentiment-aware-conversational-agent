We currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train . If you \u2019 d like , you can choose a sleeper on the overnight train which is a bit less expensive .

If two employees get married , they will leave at the same time for a honeymoon , or later one of them will stay at home taking care of babies . If they break up , the company will probably have to relocate one of them to make the workplace more comfortable . By any means , the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating . ", " But if two employees are in love , they will be happy . Happy people are more productive .

", " What's special about these things ? ", " Cranberry juice is very good for destroying harmful bacteria in your guts because it's very acidic . Wild rice is high in fibre so it's good for your guts and it's high in protein and minerals-I think it's also tastier than normal rice . Yoghurt's good because it's also rich in protein , vitamins and is also acidic . People have been making yoghurt for thousands of years and if you have it every day , your guts will be much more settled . ", " Thanks .

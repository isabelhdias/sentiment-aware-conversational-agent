He's flying out to set up a lease right now, and despite him having experience and classes in person_75, C++, and Statistics, let's change his admission status from unconditional to conditional, requiring that he take two \"bridge classes\", intro to python and intro to statistics, or else he can't continue in the program. But further, let's do that to all but one of the entering class as well, and schedule those classes all day on 4 Saturdays, starting more than 2 weeks before classes start, and we won't announce all this until a little more than a week before the first of those classes starts. (date_1). Let's also make attendance and passage mandatory, or they will be dropped from the program. I'm sure students across the country can relocate within a week's time to location_10... Also, let's keep admitting students until date_2, or even later, and with the same requirements, I'm sure it won't be an absolute logistical nightmare. \" No online option is offered. No alternate times are offered. No test-out is offered.

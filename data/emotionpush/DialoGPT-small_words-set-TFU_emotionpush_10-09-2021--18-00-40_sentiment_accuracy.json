But further, let's do that to all but one of the entering class as well, and schedule those classes all day on 4 Saturdays, starting more than 2 weeks before classes start, and we won't announce all this until a little more than a week before the first of those classes starts. (date_1). Let's also make attendance and passage mandatory, or they will be dropped from the program. I'm sure students across the country can relocate within a week's time to location_10... Also, let's keep admitting students until date_2, or even later, and with the same requirements, I'm sure it won't be an absolute logistical nightmare. \" No online option is offered. No alternate times are offered. No test-out is offered.

I wouldn't stay there, if I went, I'd transfer up after the first year, which is a common practice.
